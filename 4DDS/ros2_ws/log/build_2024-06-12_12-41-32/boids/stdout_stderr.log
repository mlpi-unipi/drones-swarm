[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:33 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findtarget_detection.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "target_detection", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "target_detection"
  with any of the following names:

    target_detectionConfig.cmake
    target_detection-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "target_detection" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "target_detection_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "target_detection" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
