[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:32 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findobstacle_avoidance.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "obstacle_avoidance", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "obstacle_avoidance" with any of the following names:

    obstacle_avoidanceConfig.cmake
    obstacle_avoidance-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "obstacle_avoidance" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "obstacle_avoidance_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "obstacle_avoidance" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
