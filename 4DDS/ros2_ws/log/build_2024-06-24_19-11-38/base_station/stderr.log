[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findparameters.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "parameters", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "parameters" with
  any of the following names:

    parametersConfig.cmake
    parameters-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "parameters" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "parameters_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "parameters" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
