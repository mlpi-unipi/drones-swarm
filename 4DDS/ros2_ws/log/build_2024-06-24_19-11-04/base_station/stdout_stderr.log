[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findfdds_messages.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "fdds_messages", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "fdds_messages"
  with any of the following names:

    fdds_messagesConfig.cmake
    fdds_messages-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "fdds_messages" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "fdds_messages_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "fdds_messages" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
