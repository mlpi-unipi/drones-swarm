[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcamera_info_manager.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "camera_info_manager", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "camera_info_manager" with any of the following names:

    camera_info_managerConfig.cmake
    camera_info_manager-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "camera_info_manager" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "camera_info_manager_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "camera_info_manager" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
